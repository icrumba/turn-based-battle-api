# Turn-Based Battle Game API

This project is a portfolio application built as part of an advanced software development and DevOps upskilling program. The goal of the project is to design and implement the backend for a web-based application using the Django framework, containerize the application with Docker, and prepare it for deployment in a cloud environment.

I chose to build the backend for a turn-based battle game because game mechanics provide a clear and engaging way to model relational data, stateful interactions, and API-driven workflows. This project emphasizes backend architecture, database design, and containerization rather than frontend development.
